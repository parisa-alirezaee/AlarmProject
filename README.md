# AlarmProject
The Unity project for the hospital alarms experiment

This code is for the last round of the experiment. There are four conditions.
One: Swipe vibration
Two: 1-2-3 pulse vibration
Three: haptic-alarm (rate based, no normal)
Four: Graphical display + audio

On the "Experimenter Setup Sheet", instead of "One" "Two" "Three" and "Four", the terms are written "Leg Swipe" "Leg Pulse" "Leg Simul" and "Graphical". But the procedure of running the test is independent from the naming and follows the instructions on the sheet.
